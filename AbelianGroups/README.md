This program is mainly used to calculate and show:

how many different(**up to isomorphism**) abelian groups of order n,for a given positive number n 

For example :if n = 360 ,there are 6 different abelian groups of order 360,they are :

This procedure will give, two results:

The total number of different abelian groups and all the specific structure of these groups
